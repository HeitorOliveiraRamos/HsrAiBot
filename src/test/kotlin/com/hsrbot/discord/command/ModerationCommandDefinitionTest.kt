/**
 * The moderation commands' definitions are only validated by Discord at registration time,
 * so a malformed one doesn't fail a build — it fails the bot's startup, in production, after
 * a deploy. These assertions run the same JDA builders and check the two things that
 * actually matter:
 *
 *  1. Every command declares the permission that gates it. This is the ONLY thing standing
 *     between an ordinary member and `/banir` — Discord hides and rejects the command based
 *     on it — so a missing or wrong permission here is a privilege-escalation bug, not a
 *     cosmetic one.
 *  2. Names are unique. [CommandRouter] indexes by name with `associateBy`, which silently
 *     keeps the last of a duplicate pair and drops the other.
