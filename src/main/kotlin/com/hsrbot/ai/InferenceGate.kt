/**
 * Bounds how many reply pipelines may run their LLM passes at once.
 *
 * A single local Ollama serializes generations internally, so without a ceiling a burst of
 * @-mentions all get scheduled on the AI executor and pile up behind each other — every
 * reply then crawls and users wait far longer than if the bot had just said "one moment".
 * This gate caps concurrency at [BotProperties.Performance.maxConcurrentInferences]; callers
 * [tryAcquire] a permit before starting and [release] it when the pipeline finishes (success
 * or failure). When no permit is free the caller short-circuits to an immediate "busy" reply
 * instead of joining the queue.
 *
 * The semaphore is fair, so waiters (should a caller ever choose to block) are served in
 * order; today callers only [tryAcquire] non-blockingly, so fairness mainly documents intent.
