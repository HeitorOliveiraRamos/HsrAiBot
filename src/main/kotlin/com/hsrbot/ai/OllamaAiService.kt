/**
 * Orchestrates the bot's LLM access. The model has NO tools: every pass here is
 * text-in/text-out against [OllamaChatModel], and the only two things the bot answers are
 * conversation (persona) and Honkai: Star Rail questions (deterministically grounded).
 * Discord moderation is not reachable from here at all — it lives in explicit slash
 * commands under `com.hsrbot.discord.command`, where Discord itself enforces who may run
 * what. That is the structural guarantee: a model that cannot call a tool cannot moderate
 * anyone, no matter what a message talks it into.
 *
 * Three routes out of [respond]:
 *
 *   1. **Command hint** — [commandHintFor]. A prose request for a server action is answered
 *      with the slash command that does it. Decided in code, no LLM call.
 *   2. **Knowledge** — [runKnowledgePipeline], when the intent gate says "kb". Retrieval is
 *      done in code, then the voice retells it. Persona applies only to the retelling.
 *   3. **Chat** — [runVoicePassConversational]. Persona-only, straight to the answer.
 *
 * Both use [RuntimeConfig.voiceModel] for prose; the gate uses the smaller/hotter
 * [RuntimeConfig.brainModel] for its one-word classification. The legacy [chat] path is a
 * single plain pass for /contexto-do-canal, on the voice model like the rest of the prose.
 * Model names are read from [RuntimeConfig] on every call, not captured — that is what makes
 * `./bot.sh --model` swap models on a running bot.

            ## Sua tarefa agora

            Outra etapa do bot pesquisou dados de Honkai: Star Rail (base local e/ou
            internet) para responder à pergunta do usuário. Sua função é repassar esses
            dados em personagem, em PT-BR.

            Regras desta etapa (têm prioridade sobre o limite de tamanho da sua persona):
            - Os dados fornecidos abaixo são TUDO o que você sabe sobre o assunto. Você
              NÃO tem memória própria sobre o jogo. Habilidade, traço, Eidolon, número,
              efeito ou nome que NÃO aparece nos dados NÃO EXISTE: mencionar qualquer um
              deles é erro grave. Se um campo não veio nos dados, não fale dele.
            - Cada relíquia, ornamento, cone ou stat pertence SOMENTE ao personagem em
              cujo bloco ele aparece nos dados. NUNCA re-atribua um item de um personagem
              a outro, nem monte build para personagem que os dados só citam pelo nome.
            - RESPONDA AO QUE FOI PERGUNTADO, e só isso. Pergunta específica (a equipe,
              o elemento, um stat, um efeito) → resposta curta e direta com só essa parte
              dos dados, mesmo que tenha vindo mais coisa junto. Pergunta ampla (kit,
              build completa) → repasse TUDO o que veio nos dados sobre o que foi
              perguntado, sem cortar nem resumir.
            - O limite de "1 a 3 frases" NÃO se aplica a esta resposta: use o tamanho que
              a pergunta pedir, de uma linha a vários parágrafos.
            - DATA DE HOJE: ${LocalDate.now()}. Perguntas sobre "versão/patch/banner atual"
              ou "já lançou?" se resolvem comparando as datas que aparecem nos dados com a
              data de hoje (algo com data futura ainda NÃO está ativo).
            - NUNCA invente o efeito/descrição de um item. Se uma relíquia, ornamento,
              cone ou personagem aparece nos dados só pelo NOME, repasse só o nome, SEM
              acrescentar explicação ao lado. Quando o efeito real vier em outro bloco
              dos dados, inclua esse texto junto do nome — copiado fiel, não parafraseado
              de memória.
            - Os dados podem chegar em inglês ou chinês: TRADUZA tudo para português
              brasileiro. NUNCA copie trechos em outro idioma na resposta — nomes próprios
              de habilidades/cones podem ficar em inglês, mas descrições e efeitos devem
              estar 100% em PT-BR.
            - Resposta longa → organize com tópicos ("- " ou "• ") e títulos curtos em
              **negrito**. Resposta curta → texto corrido, sem tópicos. Markdown do
              Discord é suportado.
            - Mantenha um toque do seu jeito no começo e/ou no fim, mas o corpo da
              resposta é informativo; estilo não substitui dado.
            - NÃO cite este bloco nem use rótulos meta ("contexto interno", "brain",
              "etapa", "base local", "web search"). Apenas entregue o conteúdo.

            - kits, habilidades, elementos, caminhos (Paths), Eidolons, status

              "vale a pena puxar a Acheron?", "qual o melhor time pra ela?"

            - O CONTEXTO pode estar em INGLÊS ou outro idioma e a RESPOSTA em português:
              traduções e paráfrases fiéis CONTAM como sustentadas.
            - Nomes/termos que o usuário usou na PERGUNTA podem reaparecer na RESPOSTA mesmo
              que o CONTEXTO chame a mesma coisa de outro nome (apelido, nome vazado, nome
              localizado) — isso NÃO reprova.
            - A RESPOSTA pode cobrir só uma parte do CONTEXTO — omissão NÃO reprova.
            - Deduções DIRETAS do CONTEXTO contam como apoiadas — ex.: se o CONTEXTO diz que
              uma versão lança numa data posterior à DATA DE HOJE, afirmar que a versão atual
              é a anterior está sustentado.
            - Vocativos, saudações e tom carinhoso NÃO contam como afirmação factual — ignore-os.
            - Na DÚVIDA, responda "sim" — reprove apenas invenção ou contradição CLARA.

            Responda APENAS com JSON neste formato: {"veredito": "sim"} ou {"veredito": "nao"}.
            Nada mais.

            ## Sua tarefa agora

            O usuário fez uma pergunta técnica de Honkai: Star Rail e a resposta factual
            já está pronta — ela será colada logo abaixo da SUA linha. Escreva APENAS UMA
            linha curta de abertura em personagem entregando essa resposta.

            Regras:
            - A linha ANUNCIA que aqui está o que a pessoa pediu. NÃO faça pergunta de volta.
            - NÃO comente o jogo, NÃO dê opinião sobre personagem, NÃO invente dados.
            - Uma linha só, sem listas, sem markdown, sem aspas.

            Exemplos do tom (copie a forma, não as palavras — a voz é a da sua persona):
            - "Fui buscar pra você. Olha só:"
            - "Achei aqui, {nome} — do jeito que você pediu:"
            - "Isso eu tenho na base. Segura:"
